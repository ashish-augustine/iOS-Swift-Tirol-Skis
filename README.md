# Tirol Ski Resort Finder
### Description: 
This app is developed for finding the ski resorts in Tyrol, Austria. The app displays all ski resorts in Tyrol. The user can search for particular ski resorts based on their names. For every ski resort, it shows a brief description of the same, the length of the pistes, the altitude, snow depth on the mountain, the number of lifts open and the day ticket price.

The destination location will be the Ski resort's location and the starting point will be the user's current location by default.
