# Tirol-Ski Resorts
### Description: 
This app is developed for finding the ski resorts in Tyrol, Austria. The app displays all ski resorts in Tyrol. The user can search for particular ski resorts based on their names. For every ski resort, it shows a brief description of the same, the length of the pistes, the altitude, snow depth on the mountain, the number of lifts open and the day ticket price. Once a ski resort is chosen, the user can navigate to that ski resort. On clicking the navigate option, the external maps will be opened and the user can chose to opt for either Apple maps or Google maps. The destination location will be the Ski resort's location and the starting point will be the user's current location by default.
